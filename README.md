# Pathfinder

Pathfinder makes routing easy.

This is a placeholder file until we create a more comprehensive README. This repository will serve as the main landing page for the codebase. Issues related to the entire project will be tracked here and the wikis will describe the high-level architecture. The server code, website and client SDKs are contained in submodules which are themselves git repositories in this organization.
